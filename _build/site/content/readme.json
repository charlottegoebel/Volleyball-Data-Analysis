Common volleyball statistics to analyze the proficiencies of a player include: serving percentage, ace percentage, kill percentagte, hitting percentage, service receiving percentage, blocking percentage, ball handling percentage, and digging percentage. However, it is difficult to analyze an indivudial player’s many statistics against themselves, which may aid in noticing and improving weaknesses.

This can be the result of high playing time and her position. Layno was a setter for a 6-2 rotation meaning she played in almost every game. Setting is where ball-handling stats come from which means that setters are expected to have higher ball-handling stats than any other player on the team. Also being a 6-2 setter means that Layno was setting from the back row so she wouldn’t have had many, if any chances to, up her blocking and kill percentages. Setters are also not supposed to serve-receive because they are ultimately the person who should be setting the ball after a pass, which they can’t do if they are the ones who passed the ball.","position":{"start":{"line":58,"column":1},"end":{"line":58,"column":1}},"key":"A2fwMIUGAW"}],"key":"jxAWRPcQZw"},{"type":"heading","depth":3,"position":{"start":{"line":61,"column":1},"end":{"line":61,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Sanford","position":{"start":{"line":61,"column":1},"end":{"line":61,"column":1}},"key":"QhRWF1H2tM"}],"identifier":"sanford","label":"Sanford","html_id":"sanford","implicit":true,"key":"LctXM5MyL6"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":62,"column":1},"end":{"line":63,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"embed","position":{"start":{"line":62,"column":1},"end":{"line":62,"column":1}},"source":{"url":"/charlotte-svballwork","label":"mack","kind":"Notebook","slug":"charlotte-svballwork","location":"/Charlotte'svballwork.ipynb"},"remove-input":true,"children":[{"type":"output","id":"zxe-tVcwquEb3y8EbkICV","data":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":85,"metadata":{},"data":{"text/plain":{"content":"<Axes: >","content_type":"text/plain"}}},{"output_type":"display_data","metadata":{},"data":{"image/png":{"content_type":"image/png","hash":"a7084055d60061f6fefa7d46f4090313","path":"/a7084055d60061f6fefa7d46f4090313.png"},"text/plain":{"content":"<Figure size 200x200 with 1 Axes>","content_type":"text/plain"}}}],"key":"CvMahpvro3"}],"key":"uhepQzLgnB"},{"type":"text","value":"\nSanford has high service receiving percentages, and kill, blocking, and service percentages.

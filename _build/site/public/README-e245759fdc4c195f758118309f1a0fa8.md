# Aspects of Volleyball

## Serving

Serving Percentage (Serv %): the number of times a player served the ball in play divided by the total number of service attempts. This statistic shows how well a player can serve the ball in bounds.

Ace Percentage (Ace %): the percentage of serves that are aces (serves where the ball may hit the court in bounds or it is met by a receiving error) divided by the total service attempts. This statistic may show how powerful, precise, and consistent a player can serve.

## Attacking 

Kill Percentage (Kill %): the percentage of attacks which are kills (an unreturnable attacked ball) divided by total hitting attempts in the season. This statistic may show how powerful, precise, or consistent an attacker can hit the ball.

Hitting Percentage (Hit %): the percentage of kills, minus attacking errors, divided by total hitting attempts in the season. Attacking errors may include hitting the ball out of bounds, in the net, or at the antenna. This statistic shows how accurate a player may hit the ball.

## Serve Receiving
Service Reception Percentage (SR %): the number of successful service receptions divided by total attempted service receptions. An unsuccessful service reception, or a service error, may happen when, receiving a serve, a player makes a ball handling error, lets the ball hit the floor in their area, passes a ball which cannot be controlled, etc. This statistic shows how well a player can handle a serve in their area.

## Blocking
Blocking Percentage (Block %): the number of successful blocks (both solo and assisted) divided by the number of block attempts (successful blocks plus block errors, which a player gets for a violation called while blocking). This statistic shows how well a player can block attacks at the net without making a violation.

## Ball Handling
Ball Handling Percentage (BH %): the number of successful ball handles, which is ball handling attempts minus the number of errors, divided by the number of ball handling attempts. This statistic shows the percentage of times a player may touch the ball without making an error called by the referee (lift, carry, double touch, etc.).

## Digging
Digging Percentage (D %): the amount of successful digs divided by the total number of attempted digs. A dig is when a player passes a ball to their own team which has been attacked by the other team. A non-successful dig, or a dig error, is made when an attacked ball hits the floor in a playerâ€™s area or the player passes an uncontrollable ball. This statistic shows how well a player can react to attacks.

+++{"part":"abstract"}
The volleyball team at the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics (NCSSM) is made up of many strong players. Common volleyball statistics to analyze the proficiencies of a player include: serving percentage, ace percentage, kill percentagte, hitting percentage, service receiving percentage, blocking percentage, ball handling percentage, and digging percentage. However, it is difficult to analyze an indivudial player's many statistics against themselves, which may aid in noticing and improving weaknesses. Our model for analyzing and plotting volleyball player data proposes a solution to this issue.

# Aspects of Volleyball

## Serving

Serving Percentage (Serv %): the number of times a player served the ball in play divided by the total number of service attempts. This statistic shows how well a player can serve the ball in bounds.

Ace Percentage (Ace %): the percentage of serves that are aces (serves where the ball may hit the court in bounds or it is met by a receiving error) divided by the total service attempts. This statistic may show a player's power, precision, and consistency when serving.

## Attacking 

Kill Percentage (Kill %): the percentage of attacks that are kills (an unreturnable attacked ball) divided by total hitting attempts in the season. This statistic may show how powerful, precise, or consistent an attacker can hit the ball.

Hitting Percentage (Hit %): the percentage of kills, minus attacking errors, divided by total hitting attempts in the season. Attacking errors may include hitting the ball out of bounds, into the net, or at the antenna. This statistic shows how accurately a player may hit the ball.

The players, numbered 1 through 10, are noted in the table below.

## Serve Receiving
Service Reception Percentage (SR %): the number of successful service receptions divided by total attempted service receptions. An unsuccessful service reception, or a service error, may happen when receiving a serve, a player makes a ball handling error, the ball hits the court, passes a ball that cannot be controlled, etc. This statistic shows how well a player can handle receiving a serve.

## Blocking
Blocking Percentage (Block %): the number of successful blocks (both solo and assisted) divided by the number of block attempts (successful blocks plus block errors, which a player gets for a violation called while blocking). This statistic shows how well a player can block attacks at the net.


## Ball Handling
Ball Handling Percentage (BH %): the number of successful ball handling touches, which is ball handling attempts minus the number of errors, divided by the number of ball handling attempts. This statistic shows the percentage of times a player may touch the ball without making an error called by the referee (lift, carry, double touch, etc.) and have it result in the winning of a point.

## Digging
Digging Percentage (D %): the amount of successful digs divided by the total number of attempted digs. A dig is when a player passes a ball to their team which the other team has attacked. A non-successful dig, or a dig error, is made when an attacked ball hits the floor in a player’s area or the player passes an uncontrollable ball. This statistic shows how well a player can react to attacks. 

## Calulations
When reporting any kind of stat percentage there are calculations that need to be done. Some of these caculations are simple, like the kill percentage, and some are a bit more complicated, like blocking perecentage.

# Stats by the Player

This analysis of each player's stats will look at the high and lows of each player. We will also look at how a player's position and court time might effect the appearence of their stats.

![](#my-cell)

### Arun
![](#saachi)
Arun has very high serving, service receiving, ball handling, kill, and digging percentages. She also has a high blocking percentage. Additionally, though hard to see, she has a good hitting percentage. This is most likely the result of high playing time. She rarely saw the bench during the season playing all the way around on the court at some point in every set of every game. Arun had more chances to put up successful stats. Her position as an outside hitter also means that her blocking and hitting percentages should be good because that is her main job on the front row. Her serve-receive and dig percentages should also be good because that is her main job when on the back row.

### Layno
![](#jules)
Layno has very high ball handling, digging, and service percentages. However, she does not have a very high kill percentage and there wasn’t enough data to determine her blocking and serve-receive percentages. This can be the result of high playing time and her position. Layno was a setter for a 6-2 rotation meaning she played in almost every game. Setting is where ball-handling stats come from which means that setters are expected to have higher ball-handling stats than any other player on the team. Also being a 6-2 setter means that Layno was setting from the back row so she wouldn’t have had many, if any chances to, up her blocking and kill percentages. Setters are also not supposed to serve-receive because they are ultimately the person who should be setting the ball after a pass, which they can’t do if they are the ones who passed the ball.

### Sanford
![](#mack)
Sanford has high service receiving percentages, and kill, blocking, and service percentages. Additionally, though hard to see, she has a very high hitting percentage. There was not enough data to determine her ball-handling percentage

### Collier
![](#claire)
Collier has very high ball handling and blocking percentages as well as good serve-receiving, digging, and serving percentages. This might be because she was often on the back row when the other team was serving, resulting in high serve-receive and digging percentages. Her position as a right side unfortunately means that she wasn’t given as many chances to up her hitting and kill percentages but it did provide ample opportunity to up her blocking percentage as she was blocking the other team’s outside hitter.

### Ulak
![](#tish)
Ulak has very high serving, serve-receiving, and digging percentages. This is most likely due to the position she plays. As a defensive specialist, she plays back row most of the time, rarely playing on the front row. Her “job” when playing is to get a good pass up to the setters. She is more likely to be in a situation where she is expected to pass and she is more likely to be good at passing of any kind.

### Okonkwo
![](#amy)
Okwonko has exceptional dig and service receiving percentages. She also has a high kill percentage.

### Donlon
![](#maren)
Donlon has high kill and dig percentages. There was not enough data to determine her block percentage

### Ellis
![](#taylor)
Ellis has a good service receiving percentage.

### Wilkins
![](#muff)
Wilkins has good service receiving, digging, and service percentages. There was not enough data to determine block percentage.

### Todd
![](#cat)
Todd has a very high blocking percentage and a great kill percentage. There was not enough data to determine ball handling or service receiving percentages.

### Woods
![](#hadley)
Woods has very high kill, hitting, ace, blocking, ball handling, service receiving, and digging percentages. She is a very well rounded player. 

# Conclusion
 The NCSSM Volleyball Team is made up of many strong players. Each player has their own strengths making them suitable players for their respective positions on the court. Our volleyball-statistic analysis makes it easy to explore an individual player's strengths and weaknesses. This arrangement of data may allow a player to improve their deficiencies or find a new volleyball position to take advantage of their strengths.
